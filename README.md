Our project is an e-commerce website featuring four main categories: books, phones, clothing, and computers. Each category shares common models for items and item details, which are used to store data. Users can add items directly from the details page without leaving, and the total value is automatically calculated. Before proceeding to checkout, users are required to sign in with a username and password or create a new account. The items in the cart are personalized based on the user's selections.
